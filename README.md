## Quantum Key Distribution with BB84 and Quantum Error Correction using Steane Code

This repository contains the implementation of the **BB84 quantum key distribution protocol**, enhanced with **quantum error correction** using the **[7,4,3] Steane code**.  
The system can **detect eavesdropping** and **correct arbitrary single-qubit errors** in a quantum communication channel.

This project was developed as part of my **Master's Thesis** in the field of quantum information and communication.
